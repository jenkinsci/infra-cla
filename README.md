# Jenkins project CLA

The Jenkins project strives for a low barrier of entry. Therefore, we require a signed CLA for core committers and people belonging to specific teams only.
If you are interested in joining the core, documentation, hosting, infrastructure, release or security team, a signed CLA is one prerequisite.

Special interest groups and general participation in the project requires no signed CLA, although we welcome anyone who's willing to submit a CLA for their work.

# How to submit a CLA

## Preamble

The Jenkins project uses the EasyCLA service provided by the Linux Foundation. We do no longer accept signed PDFs sent by email to the board or by a pull request to this repository.

The CLA process is fully automatic and requires no manual intervention by the board or any other Jenkins project member.

### Preparation

- Fork this repository, and check it out locally.
- Make a change to [pr.txt](https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla/blob/master/pr.txt).
- Commit this change, and push it to your fork.
- Create a pull request to this repository.

The `linux-foundation-easycla` bot will automatically check your pull request and add a comment to it.
It lets you know, that you haven't signed the CLA yet. Click on `Please click here to be authorized` on the bot's comment.

#### Sign an individual CLA (ICLA)

- Follow the [ICLA documentation](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/individual-contributor#github).

Step 8 can be ignored.

#### Sign a corporate CLA (CCLA)

- Follow the [CCLA documentation](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/corporate-contributor#github).

### After signing

Once you have signed the CLA successfully, the bot will automatically update its comment on your PR, to reflect the status.

You receive an email from `*@lfx.linuxfoundation.org` sending you a link to download a copy of the CLA you have signed.

You are all set now. The CLA has been signed. You can close your pull request. It acted as a workspace for the EasyCLA bot to do its job.
